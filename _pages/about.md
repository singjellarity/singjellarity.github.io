- 🌱 I’m an aspiring Data Analyst with a degree in Electronics Engineering from the Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City.
- 👀 I have an interest in data analytics, automation, machine learning, and data science.
- 🏆 I recently completed [Google's Professional Data Analytics Specialization.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/A9QTAS5TVTDP)
- ✍️ In my spare time, I write Filipino and English romance novels on Wattpad (but I'm not linking that for now, just believe me when I say I have a total of 36.6k followers and 8M total reads.)
- 📚 I used to be a voracious consumer of fiction and young adult books, but now I take my time enjoying Philippine History, business, and self-help books.
